Jessica says this crutch is designed for a 5'6" person.  The basic formula for computing the proper height of a crutch is 77% of the height of the patient.  As such this file will need to be scaled up or down for the ideal fit.  It will need to be cut out of 3/4" to 1" ply to be strong enough. Thinner plywood may work for children's crutches  After cutting, she recomends wraping the top and the handle in a standard gauze roll for padding.  There are little notches in the foot to add a little friction.  Rubber bands placed here might also help.
